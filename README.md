## RSVP App [DOM Scripting By Example]

**To Do**
Here are some possible areas for improvement:

- Reject empty string submissions by displaying a visual error
- Reject duplicate names with error
- Confirm box - change label and hide checkbox once confirmed (see text nodes for label)
- Add additional option for 'declined' - maybe use a select box?
- Hide confirmed checkbox when you hide those who haven't responded
- Change confirmed checkbox to a select for hiding declined/no responses
- Use local storage to hide the checkbox
